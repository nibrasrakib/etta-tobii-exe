We focus on the chaotic dynamics of HNN under the influence of EMR. Complex dynamical behaviors are found and transient chaotic phenomena have the same initial value sensitivity, showing how transient chaos is affected by EMR. Multiperiodic phenomena induced by quasi-periodic alternations are found in the dual EMR, as well as the suppression properties of the dual EMR for system chaos. This implies that the dynamical behavior of the HNN system can be controlled by varying the amount of EMR or the number of affected neurons in the HNN.

The underwater IPS detection model based on direct sunlight compensation is constructed, which uses the weight coefficient of underwater direct sunlight to compensate for the interference on the polarization channel and improve the accuracy of underwater polarization detection models. Furthermore, the analytical solution method for the polarization state information of underwater IPS is proposed, employing the augmented Stokes vectors to construct a linear equation for solving the weight coefficients of direct sunlight and improving the computational efficiency.

Therefore, this paper proposes an attitude and heading measurement method based on an adaptive complementary Kalman filter (ACKF), which corrects the gyroscopes according to the gravity measured by the accelerometers to improve the attitude accuracy and fuses the IMU heading and tilt-compensated polarization heading by Kalman optimal estimation. On this basis, the maximum correlation entropy of the measured gravity and the theoretical gravity is used to construct an adaptive factor to realize the adaptive complementary of the gyroscopes and the accelerometers.

Therefore, it is worthwhile to conduct an in-depth investigation into the complex dynamics of fractional-order neural networks compared to integer-order models. In this paper, we propose a magnetically controlled, memristor-based, fractional-order chaotic system under electromagnetic radiation, utilizing the Hopfield neural network (HNN) model with four neurons as the foundation. The proposed system is solved by using the Adomain decomposition method (ADM). Then, through dynamic simulations of the internal parameters of the system, rich dynamic behaviors are found, such as chaos, quasiperiodicity, direction-controllable multi-scroll, and the emergence of analogous symmetric dynamic behaviors in the system as the radiation parameters are altered, with the order remaining constant.

Compared with integer-order systems, FOD systems have higher complexity and more accurate ability to describe the real world. In this paper, two types of fractional-order memristors are proposed and one type is proved to have extreme multistability, local activity, and non-volatility. By using memristors to simulate the autapse of a neuron and to describe the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction caused by electromagnetic radiation, we establish a new 5D FOD memristive HNN (FOMHNN). Through dynamic simulation, rich dynamic behaviors are found, such as hyperchaos, multiscroll, extreme multistability, and \"overclocking\" behavior caused by order reduction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such rich dynamic behaviors are found in FOMHNN simultaneously. Based on this FOMHNN, a very efficient and secure image encryption scheme is designed. Security analysis shows that the encrypted Lena image has extremely low adjacent pixel correlation and high randomness, with information entropy of 7.9995. Despite discarding diffusion and scrambling, it has excellent plaintext sensitivity, with NCPR = 99.6095% and UACI = 33.4671%. Finally, this paper implements the proposed FOMHNN and image encryption on field programmable gate array (FPGA).

A single-emitter two-receiver positive-series rectangular coils structure and a method of calculating the structure are proposed.

However, the practical application of emotion recognition technology is limited due to the variety of subjects and sessions. Transfer learning has been applied to address this issue and has received extensive research and application. Studies mainly concentrate on either instance transfer or representation transfer methods. This paper proposes an emotion recognition method called Joint Distributed Instances Represent Transfer (JD-IRT), which includes two core components: Joint Distribution Deep Adaptation (JDDA) and Instance-Representation Transfer (I-RT). Specifically, JDDA is different from common representation transfer methods in transfer learning. It bridges the discrepancies of marginal and conditional distributions simultaneously and combines multiple adaptive layers and kernels for deep domain adaptation. On the other hand, I-RT utilizes instance transfer to select source domain data for better representation transfer. We performed experiments and compared them with other representative methods in the SEED, SEED-IV, and SEED-V datasets. In cross-subject experiments, our approach achieved an average accuracy of 83.21% in SEED, 52.12% in SEED-IV, and 60.17% in SEED-V. Similarly, in cross-session experiments, the accuracy was 91.29% in SEED, 59.02% in SEED-IV, and 65.91% in SEED-V.

This evaluation method optimized the traditional Markov Chain-Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method, and proposed an improved Metropolis-Hastings (MH) sampling method and a transitive MCMC (TMCMC) sampling method based on the MCMC theory. These two derived sampling methods solved the problem that the traditional MCMC algorithm makes it difficult to achieve convergence when the number of modified parameters is large. Therefore, on the basis of obtaining the measured sample information and the prior information of uncertain parameters, this paper first used multiple \"model components\" to form a model sample, then carried out a sensitivity analysis based on the relevant response indicators and selected the key parameters that had a great impact on the bearing capacity, carried out static load tests, and extracted and analyzed the experimental data. Then, based on a large amount of analysis data, the improved MH sampling method and TMCMC sampling method were used to establish a posterior probability distribution database. Finally, multiple posterior probability distributions were used to identify and predict the bearing capacity. The results showed that the method was feasible and effective for the evaluation of the bearing capacity of reinforced concrete beam.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36984368', 'pubdate': '2023-03-30', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': []}, {'pmid': '36823877', 'title': 'Investigation of the laser-sustained plasma of a Xenon lamp driven by an annular beam.', 'author': ['Zhaojiang Shi', 'Shichao Yang', 'Fei Yu', 'Xia Yu'], 'affiliations': [], 'abstract': 'Higher brightness UV light sources based on laser-sustained plasma (LSP) finds critical applications in high-resolution optical inspection and measurement.

To reduce the environmental load caused by the inability of synthetic plastics to degrade, polylactic acid (PLA) masks, as a biodegradable environmentally friendly plastic, may become a solution. This study simulated the actual degradation process of new PLA masks in different environments by soaking them in various solutions for 4 weeks and explored the influence of the treated PLA fabric fibers on the growth of winter ryegrass. The results show that the weathering degradation of PLA fibers in water mainly occurs through the hydrolysis of ester bonds, and weathering leads to cheese-like and gully-like erosion on the surface of the PLA fiber fabric layer and finally to fiber fracture and the release of microplastics (MPs). The average number of MPs released within 4 weeks is 149.5 items/piece, the particle size is 20-500\\xa0µm (44%), and 63.57% of the MPs are transparent fibers. The outer, middle, and inner layers of weathered PLA masks tend to be hydrophilic and have lower mechanical strength. PLA fibers after different treatment methods affect the growth of winter ryegrass. PLA masks are undoubtedly a greener choice than ordinary commercial masks, but in order to confirm this, the entire degradation process, the final products, and the impact on the environment need to be further studied. In the future, masks may be developed to be made from more environmentally friendly biodegradable materials that can have good protecting effects and also solve the problem of end-of-life recycling.

However, current chemical transport models (CTMs) typically underestimate ambient concentrations of HONO due to a dearth of high resolution primary HONO emission inventories. To address this issue, we have established a highly resolved bottom-up HONO emission inventory for CTMs in Guangdong province, utilizing the best available domestic measured emission factors and newly obtained activity data. Our results indicate that emissions from various sources in 2020, including soil, on-road traffic, non-road traffic, biomass burning, and stationary combustion, were estimated at 21.5, 10.0, 8.2, 2.5, and 0.7 kt, respectively. Notably, the HONO emissions structure differed between the Pearl River Delta (PRD) and the non-PRD regions. Specifically, traffic sources were the dominant contributors (62\\xa0%) to HONO emissions in the PRD, whereas soil sources accounted for the majority (65\\xa0%) of those in the non-PRD. Among on-road traffic sources, diesel vehicles played a significant role, contributing 99.7\\xa0%. Comparisons with previous methods suggest that HONO emissions from diesel vehicles are underestimated by approximately 2.5 times.

The sources of interspecific differences in the extent of interannual variation in seed production are largely unknown. We conducted a global meta-analysis of animal-dispersed species to quantify how the interannual variability in seed crops produced by plants can be explained by the seed mass, dispersal mode, phylogeny, and climate. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the interannual variations in seed production and seed mass tended to be similar in related species due to their shared evolution. The interannual variation in seed production was 1.22 times higher in synzoochorous species dispersed by scatter-hoarders compared with endozoochorous species dispersed by frugivores. Furthermore, the production of small seeds was associated with higher interannual variation in seed production, although synzoochorous species produced larger seeds than endozoochorous species. Precipitation rather than temperature had a significant positive effect on the interannual variation in seed production. The seed mass and dispersal mode contributed more to the interannual variation in seed production than phylogeny, climate, and fruit type.

However, the influence of increased or decreased femoral neck ante-version on the biomechanical stability of the bone-implant complex has rarely been studied.\\nA finite element model of a complete normal human femur with normal femoral neck ante-version as 13° was established accurately by scanning a 64 year old female femur. The models of 31-A1.1 intertrochanteric fractures with different femoral neck ante-version angles of 3°, 5.5°, 8°, 10.5°, 13°, 15.5°, 18°, 20.5°, 23° were created. They were assembled with a proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) device. The biomechanical differences with varying femoral neck ante-version angles were compared using finite element analysis method.\\nAs the femoral neck ante-version angle gradually increased from 13° to 23°with a gradient of 2.5°, the peak von Mises stress was gradually increased from 137.82\\xa0MPa to 276.02\\xa0MPa.

When decreased ante-version angle of 7.5° and increased ante-version angle of 10° will exceed the yield strength of femoral (240.32\\xa0MPa), the risk of femoral fracture will increase significantly. The maximum displacement of the femur was significantly reduced for increased ante-version models than for decreased ante-version models, whether the changes of ante-version angles were 2.5°, 5°, 7.5° or 10°. \\nBased on the results of present study, it was demonstrated that the anatomical reduction of femoral neck ante-version was vital to secure the optimal stability. Abnormal femoral ante-version could increase the potential risk of failure for intertrochanteric fracture after PFNA. The stability of increased femoral ante-version (less than 10°) was superior to the stability of decreased ante-version (less than 5°) for the cases of difficulty to acquire anatomical reduction. The clinical implication of the finding was that increased femoral neck ante-version had an advantage of mechanical stability towards the decreased femoral neck ante-version for the cases of

Currently, the influenza drugs recommended by the Food and Drug Administration are oseltamivir, zanamivir, peramivir, and baloxavir marboxil.

However, this trend may gradually change due to the selection of antiviral drugs and the natural evolution of IVs.

The results indicated that land cover exhibits a latitudinal distribution in mid-latitude regions and a longitudinal distribution in high and low-latitude regions. During the study period, the areas of evergreen needleleaf forests, deciduous needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, closed shrublands, and permanent wetlands exhibited fluctuating changes. Evergreen broadleaf forests and barren lands have decreased annually, whereas mixed forests, woody savannas, grasslands, urban and built-up areas, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics have increased annually. In terms of the dynamic degree, the most significant changes occurred in deciduous broadleaf forests, closed shrublands, permanent wetlands, and cropland/natural vegetation mosaics. Additionally, there were significant variations in the types and regions of land cover changes and transitions. Evergreen needleleaf forests transitioned into grassland types, and the conversion between grassland types was the main transition from mid- to high- latitude regions.

A two-dimensional refractive index distribution in the plasma region is established to obtain the propagation path of the annular beam. Subsequently, the spatial distribution of the annular beam power density is calculated to establish the quantitative relationship between laser power and plasma dimension. Theoretical analysis of a \"reservoir\" effect constructed by the annular beam is carried out. Abrupt plasma dimension change is observed when the laser power exceeds the \"reservoir\" boundary. The new model is then validated by experiments. LSP with the highest reported UV radiance to our knowledge has been achieved.

It was found that (1) compared with the literal group, the metaphor group had more insightful experiences, a greater increase in positive affect and GSES at T2, and a greater decrease in psychological distress at T2 and T3; (2) the metaphor group showed a greater activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and bilateral temporal gyrus, and further activation in the left hippocampus positively predicted T2 GSES scores while that in the IFG and left hippocampus positively predicted the reduction slope of distress over the three time points. One important limitation is that the results should be interpreted with caution when generalizing to clinical anxiety samples due to the participants were graduate students with anxiety symptoms rather than clinical sample. These results indicated that metaphor restructuring produced greater symptom improvements, and activation in the hippocampus and IFG could predict these symptom improvements.

The present review explored the possible pathogenesis, and analysed the advantages and disadvantages of the interventional measures and the need for implementation of these measures. By combining the comprehensive terms associated with LC, GERD and RE, EMBASE, Medline/PubMed and the Cochrane Library were systematically searched. The underlying pathological mechanism of GERD in LC was summarized: Transient relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter, delayed gastric emptying, increased intra-abdominal pressure, increased intragastric pressure and excessive nitric oxide production destroyed the 'anti-reflux barrier', causing gastric content reflux. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have been widely used empirically to lower the risk of oesophageal venous rupture and bleeding. However, long-term use of acid inhibitors in patients with LC may induce complications, such as spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The metabolic half-life of PPIs is prolonged in patients with severe liver function impairment. Therefore, the indications for using acid inhibitors lack clarity.

Whether an individual's susceptibility to infection and the eventual severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is influenced by their respiratory tract antibiotic resistome is unknown. Additionally, whether a relationship exists between the respiratory tract and gut ARGs composition has not been fully explored. We recruited 66 patients with COVID-19 at three disease stages (admission, progression, and recovery) and conducted a metagenome sequencing analysis of 143 sputum and 97 fecal samples obtained from them. Respiratory tract, gut metagenomes, and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) transcriptomes are analyzed to compare the gut and respiratory tract ARGs of intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU (nICU) patients and determine relationships between ARGs and immune response. Among the respiratory tract ARGs, we found that Aminoglycoside, Multidrug, and Vancomycin are increased in ICU patients compared with nICU patients. In the gut, we found that Multidrug, Vancomycin, and Fosmidomycin were increased in ICU patients. We discovered that the relative abundances of Multidrug were significantly correlated with clinical indices, and there was a significantly positive correlation between ARGs and microbiota in the respiratory tract and gut. We found that immune-related pathways in PBMC were enhanced, and they were correlated with Multidrug, Vancomycin, and Tetracycline ARGs. Based on the ARG types, we built a respiratory tract-gut ARG combined random-forest classifier to distinguish ICU COVID-19 patients from nICU patients with an AUC of 0.969.

Evidence indicated a high demand for PEP among Chinese men who have sex with men, but the uptake and access to PEP service remain limited. In an era of rapid development of web-based technology, online medical platforms in China hold great promise in facilitating PEP provision and delivery by addressing problems such as accessibility, convenience, privacy protection, and antidiscrimination by integrating online and offline resources. However, there is a paucity of data concerning the uptake and outcomes of online PEP in China.\\nThe aim of this study is to explore online PEP service provision and understand PEP uptake and outcome through a web-based cross-sectional study.\\nFrom January 2020 to June 2021, we conducted a retrospective web-based survey among those seeking online PEP services via the internet medical platform \"HeHealth\" using a structured questionnaire. Participants were surveyed on sociodemographic characteristics, sexual and drug-related behaviors, history of preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) usage, and PEP uptake. Statistical analysis included descriptive analysis, chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regression. P values <.05 were deemed statistically significant.\\nNo HIV seroconversions were observed among 539 PEP users. Our sample demonstrated that most participants seeking online PEP services were gay (397/539, 73.7%), single (470/539, 87.2%), having an education of more than 12 years (493/539, 91.5%), and with an average monthly income of 7000 RMB (1 RMB=US $0.14) or more (274/539, 50.8%). Sexual exposures accounted for 86.8% (468/539) of the cases, with anal sex being the most common indication (389/539, 72.2%) for seeking PEP use. Among 539 participants, 60.7% (327/539) sought online PEP for relatively low-risk exposures, whereas 39.3% (212/539) were considered high-risk exposures. Nearly all (537/539, 99.6%) initiated PEP within 72 hours and 68.6% (370/539) within 24 hours of exposure. All users (539/539) were prescribed a 3-drug regimen, with most comprising 3TC/TDF+DTG (lamivudine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and dolutegravir; 293/539, 54.4%), followed by FTC/TDF+DTG (emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, and dolutegravir; 158/539, 29.3%). The adjusted model showed that greater odds of PrEP usage were associated with an age of 35 years or older versus the age group of 25-34 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 2.04, 95% CI 1.24-3.37), having an education of 17 years or more versus an education of 12 years or less (AOR 3.14, 95% CI 1.29-7.62), average monthly income of 20,000 RMB or more versus less than 3000 RMB (AOR 2.60, 95% CI 1.09-6.23), and having high-risk sexual behavior during PEP treatment (AOR 2.20, 95% CI 1.05, 3.69).\\nThe 0% infection rate in this study demonstrated that online PEP could be a valuable risk-reduction option to improve HIV prevention service within China.

End-to-side anastomosis is a useful method to treat it. At present, the end-to-side anastomosis method does not involve the proximal nerve, which results in a waste of proximal donor nerves, and even the formation of traumatic neuromas at the proximal end. The patients suffer from traumatic neuralgia and the curative effect is unsatisfactory.\\nIn this study, an improved end-to-side anastomosis technique was proposed in this study: both the proximal and distal ends of the damaged common peroneal nerve were sutured to an adjacent normal tibial nerve. Moreover, the possible role and mechanism of the proposed technique were explained at the physiological and anatomical levels. In this study, a 10 mm common peroneal nerve defect was made in SD rats, and the rats were randomly divided into three groups. In Group I, the distal end of the common peroneal nerve was attached end-to-side to the fenestrated tibial nerve adventitia, and the proximal end was ligated and fixed in the nearby muscle. In Group II, the tibial nerve adventitia was fenestrated and the epineurial end-to-end anastomosis surgery was performed to suture the proximal and distal ends of the common peroneal nerve. Rats in Group III were taken as control and received sham operation. Twelve weeks after the operation, the recovery of the repaired nerve and distal effector functions were examined by the sciatic functional index, electrophysiology, osmic acid staining, the muscle wet weight ratio, and the muscle fiber cross-sectional area.\\nIt was found that these results in Group II were similar to those in Group III, but better than those in Group I. Through retrograde tracing of neurons and Electrophysiological examination in Group II, the study also found that the proximal common peroneal nerve also could establish a connection with tibialis anterior, even gastrocnemius.\\nTherefore, it is inferred that fostering both the proximal and distal ends of defective peripheral nerves on normal peripheral nerves using the end-to-side anastomosis technique is a more effective approach to repairing injured nerves.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37090979', 'pubdate': '2023-04-24', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': []}, {'pmid': '37015242', 'title': 'Fluorescence quenching determination of tetracyclines based on the synergistic oxidation effect between Fe', 'author': ['Shiqi Guo', 'Yilin Chai', 'Yongjun Wu', 'Hongchao Guo', 'Fei Yu', 'Li-E Liu', 'Leiliang He', 'Songcheng Yu', 'Yongmei Tian', 'Jia Wang', 'Ruiying Yang', 'Ningge Jian', 'Yilin Wang'], 'affiliations': [\"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Chemistry, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\\nThe Key Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Health Inspection of Zhengzhou, Zhengzhou, Henan 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\", \"College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, People's Republic of China.\"], 'abstract': 'In recent years, tetracyclines (TCs) is a hot research topic.

The proposed evacuation optimization scheme of university building complex reduces the evacuation time by 15-20% compared with the original evacuation scheme of the university. Through the simulation, it is found that the evacuation time required for sleeping at night is the shortest, while the longest evacuation time is required during lunch, due to the dispersion of students. Therefore, in addition to considering the safety awareness of the evacuees and the measured evacuation speed of stairs, the corresponding campus evacuation plan should be formulated according to the distribution of buildings in the campus complex and the actual utilization in different periods, so as to avoid the safety exit congestion and being far away from the refuge, due to the dense population in a specific period of time.

Our previous study found that the HBCDs contamination in the microcosms constructed of sediments from two different mangrove forests in 8 months resulted in serious acidification (pH2-3). This study reanalyzed previous sequencing data and compared them with data after 20 months to investigate the adaptive properties of microbial communities in the stress of HBCDs and acidification. It hypothesized that the reassembly was based on the fitness of taxa. The results indicated that eukaryotes and fungi might have better adaptive capacity to these deteriorated habitats. Eukaryotic taxa Eufallia and Syncystis, and fungal taxa Wickerhamomyces were only detected after 20 months of contamination. Moreover, eukaryotic taxa Caloneis and Nitzschia, and fungal taxa Talaromyces were dominant in most of microbial communities (14.467-95.941%). The functional compositions were sediment-dependent and more divergent than community reassemblies. Network and co-occurrence analysis suggested that acidophiles such as Acidisoma and Acidiphilium were gaining more positive relations in the long-term stress. The acidophilic taxa and genes involved in resistance to the acidification and toxicity of HBCDs were enriched, for example, bacteria Acidisoma and Acidiphilium, archaea Thermogymnomonas, and eukaryotes Nitzschia, and genes kdpC, odc1, polA, gst, and sod-2. These genes involved in oxidative stress response, energy metabolism, DNA damage repair, potassium transportation, and decarboxylation. It suggested that the microbial communities might cope with the stress from HBCDs and acidification via multiple pathways.

We define individualized interventions as those where all participants received the same parent intervention, modified on a case-by-case basis and using an evidence-based protocol, supplemented by clinical judgment as appropriate, while precision health-derived interventions are those that tailor care to individuals whereby the strategy for how to tailor care was determined through data-driven, precision health analytics. We discuss how their integration may offer new opportunities for analytics-based geriatric medicine that accommodates individual heterogeneity but allows for more flexible and resource-efficient population-level scaling.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36524627', 'pubdate': '2022-12-17', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'Humans'}, {'descriptor': 'Aged'}, {'descriptor': 'Precision Medicine'}, {'descriptor': 'Geriatrics'}]}]\n",

We and others have found that antihistamine drugs, particularly histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) antagonists, potently inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection. In this study, we provided compelling evidence that HRH1 acts as an alternative receptor for SARS-CoV-2 by directly binding to the viral spike protein. HRH1 also synergistically enhanced hACE2-dependent viral entry by interacting with hACE2. Antihistamine drugs effectively prevent viral infection by competitively binding to HRH1, thereby disrupting the interaction between the spike protein and its receptor. Multiple inhibition assays revealed that antihistamine drugs broadly inhibited the infection of various SARS-CoV-2 mutants with an average IC50 of 2.4 µM. The prophylactic function of these drugs was further confirmed by authentic SARS-CoV-2 infection assays and humanized mouse challenge experiments, demonstrating the therapeutic potential of antihistamine drugs for combating coronavirus disease 19.IMPORTANCEIn addition to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can utilize alternative cofactors to facilitate viral entry. In this study, we discovered that histamine receptor H1 (HRH1) not only functions as an independent receptor for SARS-CoV-2 but also synergistically enhances ACE2-dependent viral entry by directly interacting with ACE2. Further studies have demonstrated that HRH1 facilitates the entry of SARS-CoV-2 by directly binding to the N-terminal domain of the spike protein. Conversely, antihistamine drugs, primarily HRH1 antagonists, can competitively bind to HRH1 and thereby prevent viral entry.

Several calmodulin (CaM)-binding protein 60 (CBP60) family transcription factors (TFs) in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), including CBP60g, Systemic Acquired Resistance Deficient 1 (SARD1), CBP60a, and CBP60b, are critical for and show distinct roles in immunity. However, there are additional CBP60 members whose function is unclear. We report here that Arabidopsis CBP60c-f, four uncharacterized CBP60 members, play redundant roles with CBP60b in the transcriptional regulation of immunity responses, whose pCBP60b-driven expression compensates the loss of CBP60b. By contrast, neither CBP60g nor SARD1 is inter-changeable with CBP60b, suggesting clade-specific functionalization. We further show that function of CBP60b clade TFs relies on DNA-binding domains (DBDs) and CaM-binding domains, suggesting that they are downstream components of calcium signaling. Importantly, we demonstrate that CBP60s encoded in earliest land plant lineage Physcomitrium patens and Selaginella moellendorffii, are functionally homologous to Arabidopsis CBP60b, suggesting that the CBP60b clade contains the prototype TFs of the CBP60 family. Furthermore, tomato and cucumber CBP60b-like genes rescue the defects of Arabidopsis cbp60b and activate the expression of tomato and cucumber SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIIENT2 (SID2) and ENHANCED DISEASE SUSCEPTIBILITY 1 (EDS1) genes, suggesting that immune response pathways centered on CBP60b are also evolutionarily conserved.

To understand how meristem is determined during land plant evolution, we characterized the function of the closest PLETHORA homolog in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, which we named MpPLT. Through transgenic approach, we showed that MpPLT is expressed not only in the stem cells at the apical notch but also in the proliferation zone of the meristem, as well as cells that form the air-pore complex and rhizoids. Using the CRISPR method we then created mutants for MpPLT and found that the mutants are not only defective in meristem maintenance but also compromised in air-pore complex and rhizoid development. Strikingly, at later developmental stages, numerous gemma-like structures were formed in Mpplt mutants, suggesting developmental arrest. Further experiments indicate that MpPLT promotes plant growth by regulating MpWOX, which shared a similar expression pattern as MpPLT, and genes involved in auxin and cytokinin signaling pathways. Through transcriptome analyses, we found that MpPLT also has a role in redox homeostasis and that this role is essential to plant growth.

free HIV-1 envelope protein (gp120) has yet to be elucidated. Our group previously showed that EP2 derived from one β-strand in gp120 can form amyloid fibrils that increase HIV-1 infectivity. Importantly, gp120 contains ~30 β-strands. We examined whether gp120 might serve as a precursor protein for the proteolytic release of amyloidogenic fragments that form amyloid fibrils, thereby promoting viral infection. Peptide array scanning, enzyme degradation assays, and viral infection experiments in vitro confirmed that many β-stranded peptides derived from gp120 can indeed form amyloid fibrils that increase HIV-1 infectivity. These gp120-derived amyloidogenic peptides, or GAPs, which were confirmed to form amyloid fibrils, were termed gp120-derived enhancers of viral infection (GEVIs). GEVIs specifically capture HIV-1 virions and promote their attachment to target cells, thereby increasing HIV-1 infectivity. Different GAPs can cross-interact to form heterogeneous fibrils that retain the ability to increase HIV-1 infectivity. GEVIs even suppressed the antiviral activity of a panel of antiretroviral agents. Notably, endogenous GAPs and GEVIs were found in the lymphatic fluid, lymph nodes, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of AIDS patients in vivo. Overall, gp120-derived amyloid fibrils might play a crucial role in the process of HIV-1 infectivity and thus represent novel targets for anti-HIV therapeutics.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38443447', 'pubdate': '2024-03-06', 'pubYear': '2024', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'HIV Envelope Protein gp120'}, {'descriptor': 'HIV-1'}, {'descriptor': 'Humans'}, {'descriptor': 'Amyloid'}, {'descriptor': 'HIV Infections'}, {'descriptor': 'Amyloidogenic Proteins'}, {'descriptor': 'Virion'}, {'descriptor': 'Peptides'}]}, {'pmid': '38391271', 'title': 'TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2 defines trichome cell shape by modulating actin cytoskeleton in Arabidopsis thaliana.', 'author': ['Lu Liu', 'Yali Wang', 'Weihua Cao', 'Lan Yang', 'Chi Zhang', 'Lanxin Yuan', 'Dan Wang', 'Wenjia Wang', 'Hongchang Zhang', 'John Schiefelbein', 'Fei Yu', 'Lijun An'], 'affiliations': ['State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'CAS Center for Excellence in Molecular Plant Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200032, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI 48109, USA.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi 712100, China.'], 'abstract': 'The Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA2 (TTG2) gene encodes a WRKY transcription factor that regulates a range of development events like trichome, seed coat, and atrichoblast formation.

In contrast to the ttg2 mutants described before, ttg2-6 displayed unique trichome phenotypes. Some ttg2-6 mutant trichomes were hyper-branched, whereas others were hypo-branched, distorted, or clustered. Further, we found that in addition to specifically activating R3 MYB transcription factor TRIPTYCHON (TRY) to modulate trichome specification, TTG2 also integrated cytoskeletal signaling to regulate trichome morphogenesis. The ttg2-6 trichomes displayed aberrant cortical microtubules (cMTs) and actin filaments (F-actin) configurations. Moreover, genetic and biochemical analyses showed that TTG2 could directly bind to the promoter and regulate the expression of BRICK1 (BRK1), which encodes a subunit of the actin nucleation promoting complex suppressor of cyclic AMP repressor (SCAR)/Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein family verprolin homologous protein (WAVE).

Our and others' works have shown that the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)-containing exosomes (ACE2-exos) have superior antiviral efficacies, especially in response to emerging variants. However, the mechanisms of how the virus counteracts the host and regulates ACE2-exos remain unclear. Here, we identified that SARS-CoV-2 nonstructural protein 6 (NSP6) inhibits the production of ACE2-exos by affecting the protein level of ACE2 as well as tetraspanin-CD63 which is a key factor for exosome biogenesis. We further found that the protein stability of CD63 and ACE2 is maintained by the deubiquitination of proteasome 26S subunit, non-ATPase 12 (PSMD12). NSP6 interacts with PSMD12 and counteracts its function, consequently promoting the degradation of CD63 and ACE2. As a result, NSP6 diminishes the antiviral efficacy of ACE2-exos and facilitates the virus to infect healthy bystander cells. Overall, our study provides a valuable target for the discovery of promising drugs for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019.\\nThe outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severely endangers global public health.

The identification of a new target for blocking SARS-CoV-2 depends on fully understanding the virus-host interaction networks.

Of note, among these mechanisms, the miRNA/RBP sponge function has been the most investigated one. Recent research has uncovered the presence of various proteins or peptides encoded by circRNA. CircRNAs are translated independent of the 5' cap and 3' polyA tail, which are typical elements for linear RNA translation. Some unique elements, such as internal ribosome entry sites and N‑methyladenosine modifications, facilitate the initiation of translation. These circRNA‑encoded proteins or peptides participate in diverse signalling pathways and act as important regulators in carcinogenesis by influencing cell proliferation, migration, apoptosis and other key processes. Consequently, circRNA‑encoded proteins or peptides have great potential as therapeutic targets for anticancer drugs.

Vaccination is the most promising strategy for the prevention of infectious diseases. Immersion vaccination is considered the most effective disease prevention method for juvenile fish because it can be implemented on many fish at once and administered without causing stress. However, immune responses by immersion vaccination are markedly less robust due to the skin barrier and insufficient antigen uptake. The display of heterologous proteins on the cell surface has been explored as a delivery system for viral antigens in veterinary and human vaccine studies. To improve the efficacy of the immersion vaccine, the major capsid protein (VP7) of GCRV was co-displayed with Aeromonas hydrophila outer membrane protein a (OmpA) and major adhesion protein (Mah) on the outer membrane surface of nonpathogenic Escherichia coli BL21 using the anchoring motif of ice-nucleation protein (Inp). The immune responses and protection efficiency against GCRV infection via both the injection and immersion routes were evaluated. The results indicated that the activities of anti-oxidant enzymes (ACP, AKP, SOD and T-AOC), as well as the expression of immune-related genes (TNF-α, IL-1β, MHCI and IgM) and specific VP7 antibody levels, were strongly increased in the grass carp from 7 to 21 days post-injection inoculation in a dose dependent manner. The cumulative mortality rates of injection-vaccinated groups were much lower than those of the control group after the GCRV challenge, and the relative percent survival (RPS) was greater than 80\\xa0%. Vitally, the surface co-display of vp7-Mah protein conferred marked protection to grass carp against GCRV infection after immersion administration (RPS >50\\xa0%); this was consistent with the production of high level of specific serum antibodies, non-specific immune responses, and the expression of immune-related genes. Moreover, the invasion analysis further showed that surface co-display of the vp7-Mah protein indeed significantly improved the invasion of E. coli BL21 (DE3) in vitro.

MiRNAs serve as crucial regulators in the developmental processes of mammalian hair follicles. Understanding the regulation of miRNAs during the hair follicle cycle is essential for enhancing cashmere quality. In this investigation, we employed high-throughput sequencing technology to analyze the expression profiles of miRNAs in the secondary hair follicles of Jiangnan cashmere goats at different stages. Through bioinformatics analysis, we identified differentially expressed miRNAs (DE miRNAs). The regulatory relationships between miRNAs and their target genes were verified using multiple techniques, including RT-qPCR, western blot, Dual-Luciferase Reporter, and CKK-8 assays. Our findings revealed the presence of 193 DE miRNAs during various stages of the hair follicle cycle in Jiangnan cashmere goats. Based on the previously obtained mRNA data, the target genes of DE miRNA were predicted, and 1,472 negative regulatory relationships between DE miRNAs and target genes were obtained. Notably, the expression of chi-miR-877-3p was down-regulated during the telogen (Tn) phase compared to the anagen (An) and catagen (Cn) phases, while the IGFBP5 gene exhibited up-regulation. Further validation experiments confirmed that overexpression of chi-miR-877-3p in dermal papilla cells suppressed IGFBP5 gene expression and facilitated cell proliferation. The results of this study provide novel insights for analyzing the hair follicle cycle.\\nCashmere goats, known for their diverse range of animal products including delectable meat, soft sheepskin, and high-quality natural fiber, offer an excellent opportunity to explore hair regeneration as they represent a heterogenous fur mammal. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNA molecules encoded by approximately 3% of mammalian genes. Remarkably, they have the ability to regulate around 30% of protein-coding genes. Given that a single miRNA can target multiple genes, they exert control over various biological functions such as metabolism, growth, development, and immunity. In this study, we found that miR-877-3p is able to regulate the expression of insulin-like growth factor binding protein 5 (IGFBP5), a key gene involved in the development of the hair follicle cycle. Investigating the regulatory role of miRNAs in the hair follicle cycle of cashmere goats provides a novel perspective for unraveling the mechanisms underlying hair follicle growth and development in mammals.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37777862', 'pubdate': '2023-10-01', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'Animals'}, {'descriptor': 'Hair Follicle'}, {'descriptor': 'MicroRNAs'}, {'descriptor': 'Goats'}, {'descriptor': 'Gene Expression Profiling'}, {'descriptor': 'Hair'}]}, {'pmid': '37745212', 'title': 'Heparan sulfate is the attachment factor associated with channel catfish virus infection on host cells.', 'author': ['Fei Yu', 'Hongxun Chen', 'Jiehua Xu', 'Yu Wang', 'Chunlan Nie', 'Siyang Song', 'Lihui Meng', 'Kai Hao', 'Zhe Zhao'], 'affiliations': ['Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.', 'Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center for Marine Bio-resources Sustainable Utilization, College of Oceanography, Hohai University, Nanjing, China.'], 'abstract': 'Channel catfish virus (CCV; family ', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37745212', 'pubdate': '2023-09-25', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': []}, {'pmid': '37668229', 'title': 'Interaction of PALE CRESS with PAP2/pTAC2 and PAP3/pTAC10 affects the accumulation of plastid-encoded RNA polymerase complexes in Arabidopsis.', 'author': ['Xiaomin Wang', 'Yafei Qi', 'Na Liu', 'Qiaoxin Zhang', 'Sha Xie', 'Yang Lei', 'Bilang Li', 'Jingxia Shao', 'Fei Yu', 'Xiayan Liu'], 'affiliations': ['State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.\\nInstitute of Future Agriculture, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.', 'State Key Laboratory of Crop Stress Biology for Arid Areas and College of Life Sciences, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, Shaanxi, 712100, China.'], 'abstract': 'The transcription of photosynthesis genes in chloroplasts is largely mediated by the plastid-encoded RNA polymerase (PEP), which resembles prokaryotic-type RNA polymerases, but with plant-specific accessory subunits known as plastid transcriptionally active chromosome proteins (pTACs) or PEP-associated proteins (PAPs).

Despite numerous efforts, the regulation of this process in land plants is largely unknown. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of pale green Arabidopsis4 (pga4) mutants in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) with defects in chloroplast development during de-etiolation. Map-based cloning and complementation assays confirmed that PGA4 encodes the chloroplast Signal Recognition Particle 54 kDa (cpSRP54) protein. A heterogeneous Light-Harvesting Chlorophyll a/b Binding-Green Fluorescent Protein (LhcB2-GFP) fusion protein was generated as an indicative reporter for cpSRP54-mediated thylakoid translocation. LhcB2-GFP was dysfunctional and degraded to a short-form dLhcB2-GFP during de-etiolation through an N-terminal degradation initiated on thylakoid membranes. Further biochemical and genetic evidence demonstrated that the degradation of LhcB2-GFP to dLhcB2-GFP was disrupted in pga4 and yellow variegated2 (var2) mutants caused by mutations in the Filamentous Temperature-Sensitive H2 (VAR2/AtFtsH2) subunit of thylakoid FtsH. The yeast two-hybrid assay showed that the N-terminus of LhcB2-GFP interacts with the protease domain of VAR2/AtFtsH2. Moreover, the over-accumulated LhcB2-GFP in pga4 and var2 formed protein aggregates, which were insoluble in mild nonionic detergents. Genetically, cpSRP54 is a suppressor locus for the leaf variegation phenotype of var2.

Biofilms allow the development and maintenance of locally corrosive environments and/or permit direct corrosion including pitting corrosion. The presence of numerous genetically distinct microorganisms in the oral environment poses a threat to the integrity and durability of the surface of metallic prostheses and implants used in routine dentistry. However, the association between oral microorganisms and specific corrosion mechanisms is not clear. It is of practical importance to understand how microbial corrosion occurs and the associated risks to metallic materials in the oral environment. This knowledge is also important for researchers and clinicians who are increasingly concerned about the biological activity of the released corrosion products. Accordingly, the main goal was to comprehensively review the current literature regarding oral microbiologically influenced corrosion (MIC) including characteristics of biofilms and of the oral environment, MIC mechanisms, corrosion behavior in the presence of oral microorganisms and potentially mitigating technologies. Findings included that oral MIC has been ascribed mostly to aggressive metabolites secreted during microbial metabolism (metabolite-mediated MIC). However, from a thermodynamic point of view, extracellular electron transfer mechanisms (EET-MIC) through pili or electron transfer compounds cannot be ruled out. Various MIC mitigating methods have been demonstrated to be effective in short term, but long term evaluations are necessary before clinical applications can be considered. Currently most in-vitro studies fail to simulate the complexity of intraoral physiological conditions which may either reduce or exacerbate corrosion risk, which must be addressed in future studies. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: A thorough analysis on literature regarding oral MIC (microbiologically influenced corrosion) of biomedical metallic materials has been carried out, including characteristics of oral environment, MIC mechanisms, corrosion behaviors in the presence of typical oral microorganisms and potential mitigating methods (materials design and surface design). There is currently a lack of mechanistic understanding of oral MIC which is very important not only to corrosion researchers but also to dentists and clinicians. This paper discusses the significance of biofilms from a biocorrosion perspective and summarizes several aspects of MIC mechanisms which could be caused by oral microorganisms. Oral MIC has been closely associated with not only the materials research but also the dental/clinical research fields in this work.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=38942189', 'pubdate': '2024-06-29', 'pubYear': '2024', 'meshHeadings': []}, {'pmid': '38858393', 'title': 'Reactive P and S co-doped porous hollow nanotube arrays for high performance chloride ion storage.', 'author': ['Siyang Xing', 'Ningning Liu', 'Qiang Li', 'Mingxing Liang', 'Xinru Liu', 'Haijiao Xie', 'Fei Yu', 'Jie Ma'], 'affiliations': ['Research Center for Environmental Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, PR China.\\nDepartment of Energy, Environmental & Chemical Engineering, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, MO, 63130, USA.', 'Research Center for Environmental Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, PR China.', 'Research Center for Environmental Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, PR China.', 'Research Center for Environmental Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, PR China.\\nCollege of Chemistry and Environmental Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.\\nCollege of Physics and Optoelectronic Engineering, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, PR China.', 'Research Center for Environmental Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, PR China.\\nSchool of Architecture, Civil and Environmental Engineering, EPFL, Lausanne, Vaud1015, Switzerland.', \"Hangzhou Yanqu Information Technology Co., Ltd., Y2, 2nd Floor, Building 2, Xixi Legu Creative Pioneering Park, No. 712 Wen'er West Road, Xihu District, Hangzhou, 310003, PR China.\", 'College of Oceanography and Ecological Science, Shanghai Ocean University, No 999, Huchenghuan Road, Shanghai, 201306, PR China.', 'Research Center for Environmental Functional Materials, State Key Laboratory of Pollution Control and Resource Reuse, College of Environmental Science and Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, 200092, PR China. jma@tongji.edu.cn.\\nSchool of Civil Engineering, Kashi University, Kashi, 844000, PR China. jma@tongji.edu.cn.'], 'abstract': 'Developing stable, high-performance chloride-ion storage electrodes is essential for energy storage and water purification application.

The predictive performance was evaluated by area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analyses in the training set and external validation sets. Finally, RT‒qPCR and Western blotting were conducted to verify the expression of these hub genes in blood samples. In addition, Pearson correlation analysis was utilized to validate the association between expression of hub genes and circadian rhythm function.\\nOur clinical observational study revealed that even early-stage PD patients exhibited a higher likelihood of experiencing sleep disturbances, nocturnal hypertension, reverse-dipper blood pressure, and reduced heart rate variability compared to healthy controls. Furthermore, 4 CR-related hub genes (AGTR1, CALR, BRM14, and XPA) were identified and subsequently incorporated as candidate biomarkers to construct a diagnostic model. The model showed satisfactory diagnostic performance in the training set (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.941), an external validation set GSE20295 (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.842), and our clinical centre set (AUC\\u2009=\\u20090.805). Additionally, the up-regulation of CALR, BRM14 and the down-regulation of AGTR1, XPA were associated with circadian rhythm disruption.\\nCR disturbance seems to occur in the early stage of PD.

Long-acting injectable-pre-exposure prophylaxis (LAI-PrEP), requiring less frequent dosing, is being studied as an alternative method to daily oral HIV PrEP. With the addition of this potential new prevention method, it expands the scope for a wider user choice and is expected to increase the acceptability and uptake of HIV prevention measures. The aim of our study was to explore the willingness to use LAI-PrEP and associated influential factors.\\nParticipants were recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 through banner advertisements on web- and mobile app-based platforms on Blued, a large gay Chinese social media platform. MSM in our cross-sectional study was HIV-negative and currently lived in mainland China. Participants were asked about their willingness to use LAI-PrEP and reasons why they might be or not be willing to use LAI-PrEP. Multivariable logistic regression was used to analyze the factors associated with the willingness to use LAI-PrEP.\\nIn total, 969 participants met the inclusion criteria and finished the survey. Nearly twenty percent (19.5%) of participants had never tested for HIV; 66.8% of MSM had multiple male partners; and 51.6% of MSM engaged in condomless sex with their partner. About three-fifths (66.3%) of MSM were aware of PrEP, and only 3.9% of MSM had used PrEP before. The willingness to use LAI-PrEP among MSM was 74.0% (95% CI: 71.4%-76.6%).

The main contributing mechanisms include excessive inflammation and delayed wound healing. Existing clinical therapies have limitations, promoting the exploration of alternative methods that offer improved efficacy and reduced side effects. Adipose-derived stem cell-exosome (ADSC-Exo) has the potential to sustain immune homeostasis and facilitate tissue regeneration. Nevertheless, natural ADSC-Exo lacks disease specificity and exhibits limited bioavailability on the ocular surface. In this study, we conjugated antitumor necrosis factor-α antibodies (aT) to the surface of ADSC-Exo using matrix metalloproteinase-cleavable peptide chains to create engineered aT-Exo with synergistic effects. In both in vivo and in vitro assessments, aT-Exo demonstrated superior efficacy in mitigating corneal injuries compared to aT alone, unmodified exosomes, or aT simply mixed with exosomes. The cleavable conjugation of aT-Exo notably enhanced wound healing and alleviated inflammation more effectively. Simultaneously, we developed poly(vinyl alcohol) microneedles (MNs) for precise and sustained exosome delivery. The in vivo results showcased the superior therapeutic efficiency of MNs compared with conventional topical administration and subconjunctival injection.

QRT-PCR analysis was utilized to assess the expression levels of hsa-circ-0003764 in both HCC tissues and cells. We conducted in vitro and in vivo experiments to examine the impact of circPTPN12 on the proliferation and apoptosis of HCC cells.

CircPTPN12 exhibited suppressive effects on the proliferation of HCC cells both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, RNA sequencing assays unveiled the NF-κB signaling pathway as a targeted pathway of circPTPN12. Functionally, circPTPN12 was found to interact with the PDZ domain of PDLIM2, facilitating the ubiquitination of P65. Furthermore, circPTPN12 bolstered the assembly of the PDLIM2/OTUD6B complex by promoting the deubiquitination of PDLIM2.

Gene subtypes were categorized by machine learning algorithms. The machine learning-related breast cancer (MLBC) score was evaluated through principal component analysis (PCA) of clinical patients' pathological statuses and subtypes. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using the xCell and CIBERSORT algorithms. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis elucidated regulatory pathways related to speedy/RINGO cell cycle regulator family member C (SPDYC) in breast cancer. The biological functions and lipid metabolic status of breast cancer cell lines were validated via quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT‒qPCR) assays, western blotting, CCK-8 assays, PI‒Annexin V fluorescence staining, transwell assays, wound healing assays, and Oil Red O staining. Key differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in breast cancer from the TCGA and GEO databases were screened and utilized to establish\\xa0the MLBC score. Moreover, the MLBC score we established was negatively correlated with poor prognosis in breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the impacts of SPDYC on the tumor immune microenvironment and lipid metabolism in breast cancer were revealed and validated. SPDYC is closely related to activated dendritic cells and macrophages and is simultaneously correlated with the immune checkpoints CD47, cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4), and poliovirus receptor (PVR). SPDYC strongly correlated with C-C motif chemokine ligand 7 (CCL7), a chemokine that influences breast cancer patient prognosis. A significant relationship was discovered between key genes involved in lipid metabolism and SPDYC, such as ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 (ELOVL2), malic enzyme 1 (ME1), and squalene epoxidase (SQLE). Potent inhibitors targeting SPDYC in breast cancer were also discovered, including JNK inhibitor VIII, AICAR, and JW-7-52-1. Downregulation of SPDYC expression in vitro decreased proliferation, increased the apoptotic rate, decreased migration, and reduced lipid droplets. SPDYC possibly influences the tumor immune microenvironment and regulates lipid metabolism in breast cancer.

Unfortunately, effective treatment strategies for sepsis are still lacking. The intricate interplay between metabolism and the immune system limits the treatment options for sepsis. During sepsis, there is a profound shift in cellular energy metabolism, which triggers a metabolic reprogramming of immune cells. This metabolic alteration impairs immune responses, giving rise to excessive inflammation and immune suppression. Recent research has demonstrated that UCP2 not only serves as a critical target in sepsis but also functions as a key metabolic switch involved in immune cell-mediated inflammatory responses. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying this modulation are complex. This article focuses on UCP2 as a target and discusses metabolic reprogramming during sepsis and the complex regulatory mechanisms between different stages of inflammation.

However, there is no effective drug for treatments. This study investigated the effect of D-pinitol (DP) on cardiac injury using diabetic mice and glycosylation injury of cardiomyocytes and its molecular mechanisms. We established the streptozotocin-induced SAMR1 and SAMP8 mice and DP (150\\u2009mg/kg/day) intragastrically and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs)-induced H9C2 cells. H9C2 cells were transfected with optineurin (OPTN) siRNA and overexpression plasmids. The metabolic disorder indices, cardiac dysfunction, histopathology, immunofluorescence, western blot, and immunoprecipitation were investigated. Our results showed that DP reduced the blood glucose and AGEs, and increased the expression of heart OPTN in diabetic mice and H9C2 cells, thereby inhibiting the endoplasmic reticulum stress (GRP78, CHOP) and glycophagy (STBD1, GABARAPL1), and alleviating the myocardial apoptosis and fibrosis of DCM. The expression of filamin A as an interaction protein of OPTN downregulated by AGEs decreased OPTN abundance. Moreover, OPTN siRNA increased the expression of GRP78, CHOP, STBD1, and GABARAPL1 and inhibited the expression of GAA via GSK3β phosphorylation and FoxO1.

PCD plays an important role in a multitude of biological processes, such as cell turnover, development, tissue homeostasis and immunity. Some forms of PCD, including apoptosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, pyroptosis, ferroptosis and necroptosis, contribute to carcinogenesis and cancer development, and thus have attracted increasing attention in the field of oncology. Recently, increasing research-based evidence has demonstrated that PCD acts as a critical modulator of tumor immunity. PCD can affect the function of innate and adaptive immune cells, which leads to distinct immunological consequences, such as the priming of tumor-specific T cells, immunosuppression and immune evasion. Targeting PCD alone or in combination with conventional immunotherapy may provide new options to enhance the clinical efficacy of anticancer therapeutics. In this review, we introduce the characteristics and mechanisms of ubiquitous PCD pathways (e.g., apoptosis, autophagy-dependent cell death, pyroptosis and ferroptosis) and explore the complex interaction between these cell death mechanisms and tumor immunity based on currently available evidence. We also discuss the therapeutic potential of PCD-based approaches by outlining clinical trials targeting PCD in cancer treatment. Elucidating the immune-related effects of PCD on cancer pathogenesis will likely contribute to an improved understanding of oncoimmunology and allow PCD to be exploited for cancer treatment.', 'html':

Differentiation therapy is emerging as an important treatment modality for leukemia, given its less toxicity and wider applicable population, but the arsenal of differentiation-inducing agents is still very limited. In this study, we adapted a competitive peptide phage display platform to search for candidate peptides that could functionally induce human leukemia cell differentiation. A monoclonal phage (P6) and the corresponding peptide (pep-P6) were identified. Both L- and D-chirality of pep-P6 showed potent efficiency in inducing AML cell line differentiation, driving their morphologic maturation and upregulating the expression of macrophage markers and cytokines, including CD11b, CD14, IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α. In the THP-1 xenograft animal model, administration of D-pep-P6 was effective in inhibiting disease progression. Importantly, exposure to D-pep-P6 induced the differentiation of primary human leukemia cells isolated AML patients in a similar manner to the AML cell lines. Further mechanism study suggested that D-pep-P6 induced human leukemia cell differentiation by directly activating a TLR-2 signaling pathway.

Our study revolves around probing the inhibitory action of PlaS on E. coli BL21 (DE3).

This phenomenon is validated through scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis, which highlights PlaS's capacity to compromise membrane integrity.

Addressing this condition presents significant challenges and complexities. Betulinic acid (BA), known for its potent antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, has garnered extensive attention; nevertheless, the impact upon neuropathic pain induced by CCI is still uncertain. This paper explores the analgesic effects concerning BA on mice experiencing neuropathic pain due to sciatic nerve injury. Throughout the experiment, mice with CCI received oral gavage of BA at dosages of 3, 10, and 30\\xa0mg/kg for consecutively 8\\xa0days from the 7th day post-surgery. To assess their responses, behavioral tests and sciatic functional index (SFI) evaluations were conducted on zeroth, seventh, eighth, tenth, twelveth and fourteenth day post-CCI. On day 14, histopathological examinations and measurements of biochemical markers were performed. Immunofluorescence techniques were employed to detect Nrf2 and glial cell activation, while the Western blot method was utilized to evaluate Nrf2/HO-1 protein levels and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. The results elucidated that BA significantly alleviated hyperalgesia and allodynia, demonstrating a dose-dependent enhancement in sciatic nerve function and facilitating the recovery of sciatic nerve injury. Furthermore, BA prominently augmented the entire antioxidative capacity (T-AOC) and T-SOD levels, concomitantly reducing MDA concentrations. Notably, BA activated the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, inhibited glial cell activation, and downregulation of the expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, specifically, TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 were observed. As such, this study provides a basis to support BA as a candidate drug for the treatment of neuropathic pain, attributing its analgesic effects to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidative, and neuroprotective properties.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37574162', 'pubdate': '2023-08-14', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'Mice'}, {'descriptor': 'Animals'}, {'descriptor': 'Betulinic Acid'}, {'descriptor': 'Constriction'}, {'descriptor': 'NF-E2-Related Factor 2'}, {'descriptor': 'Sciatic Nerve'}, {'descriptor': 'Sciatic Neuropathy'}, {'descriptor': 'Cytokines'}, {'descriptor': 'Hyperalgesia'}, {'descriptor': 'Neuralgia'}, {'descriptor': 'Analgesics'}, {'descriptor': 'Anti-Inflammatory Agents'}]}, {'pmid': '37567522', 'title': 'A thin film comprising silk peptide and cellulose nanofibrils implanting on the electrospun poly(lactic acid) fibrous scaffolds for biomedical reconstruction.', 'author': ['Siyi Zhang', 'Fei Yu', 'Jin Chen', 'Dan Yan', 'Danni Gong', 'Liangbo Chen', 'Junzhao Chen', 'Qinke Yao'], 'affiliations': [\"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.\", \"Department of Ophthalmology, Ninth People's Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, 639 Zhizaoju Road, Shanghai 200011, China; Shanghai Key Laboratory of Orbital Diseases and Ocular Oncology, Shanghai 200011, China.

The patterns of these mechanical forces (laminar vs. turbulent) regulate endothelial cell function and play an important role in determining endothelial phenotype and ultimately cardiovascular health. One of the key transcriptional mediators of the positive effects of laminar flow patterns on endothelial cell phenotype is the zinc-finger transcription factor, krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2). Given its importance in maintaining a healthy endothelium, we sought to identify endothelial regulators of the KLF2 transcriptional program as potential new therapeutic approaches to treating cardiovascular disease. Using an approach that utilized both bioinformatics and targeted gene knockdown, we identified endothelial GPCRs capable of modulating KLF2 expression. Genetic screening using siRNAs directed to these GPCRs identified 12 potential GPCR targets that could modulate the KLF2 program, including a subset capable of regulating flow-induced KLF2 expression in primary endothelial cells. Among these targets, we describe the ability of several GPCRs (GPR116, SSTR3, GPR101, LGR4) to affect KLF2 transcriptional activation. We also identify these targets as potential validated targets for the development of novel treatments targeting the endothelium. Finally, we highlight the initiation of drug discovery efforts for LGR4 and report the identification of the first known synthetic ligands to this receptor as a proof-of-concept for pathway-directed phenotypic screening to identify novel drug targets.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37363403', 'pubdate': '2023-06-26', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': []}, {'pmid': '37354741', 'title': 'Nine-valent oleanolic acid conjugates as potent inhibitors blocking the entry of influenza A virus.', 'author': ['Liang Shao', 'Yangqing Su', 'Yuan Zhang', 'Fan Yang', 'Jihong Zhang', 'Tao Tang', 'Fei Yu'], 'affiliations': ['Medical School of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China.', 'Medical School of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China.', 'Medical School of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China.', 'Medical School of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China.', 'Medical School of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China.', 'Medical School of Kunming University of Science and Technology, Kunming, Yunnan, 650500, China.

COVID-19 is characterized by a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to mild cold-like symptoms, severe pneumonia or even death. Inflammasomes are supramolecular signaling platforms that assemble in response to danger or microbial signals. Upon activation, inflammasomes mediate innate immune defense by favoring the release of proinflammatory cytokines and triggering pyroptotic cell death. Nevertheless, abnormalities in inflammasome functioning can result in a variety of human diseases such as autoimmune disorders and cancer. A growing body of evidence has showed that SARS-CoV-2 infection can induce inflammasome assembly. Dysregulated inflammasome activation and consequent cytokine burst have been associated with COVID-19 severity, alluding to the implication of inflammasomes in COVID-19 pathophysiology. Accordingly, an improved understanding of inflammasome-mediated inflammatory cascades in COVID-19 is essential to uncover the immunological mechanisms of COVID-19 pathology and identify effective therapeutic approaches for this devastating disease. In this review, we summarize the most recent findings on the interplay between SARS-CoV-2 and inflammasomes and the contribution of activated inflammasomes to COVID-19 progression. We dissect the mechanisms involving the inflammasome machinery in COVID-19 immunopathogenesis. In addition, we provide an overview of inflammasome-targeted therapies or antagonists that have potential clinical utility in COVID-19 treatment.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37251383', 'pubdate': '2023-05-30', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'Humans'}, {'descriptor': 'COVID-19'}, {'descriptor': 'Inflammasomes'}, {'descriptor': 'SARS-CoV-2'}, {'descriptor': 'COVID-19 Drug Treatment'}, {'descriptor': 'Cytokines'}]}, {'pmid': '37221600', 'title': 'TMT proteomics analysis reveals the mechanism of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis and effects of Ginseng honeysuckle superfine powdered tea.', 'author': ['Xiaoli Li', 'Xin Yu', 'Yuan Gao', 'Wenqian Zhao', 'Yajuan Wang', 'Fei Yu', 'Chunli Fu', 'Haiqing Gao', 'Mei Cheng', 'Baoying Li'], 'affiliations': ['Department of Pharmacy, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.', \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China.\", \"Department of Geriatric Medicine, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, Jinan, 250012, China. jncm65@email.sdu.edu.cn.\\nKey Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China. jncm65@email.sdu.edu.cn.\\nJinan Clinical Research Center for Geriatric Medicine, 202132001, Jinan, 250012, China. jncm65@email.sdu.edu.cn.\", \"Key Laboratory of Cardiovascular Proteomics of Shandong Province, Qilu Hospital of Shandong University, 107 Wenhuaxi Road, Jinan, 250012, Shandong, People's Republic of China. libaoying77@163.com.\\nJinan Aixinzhuoer Medical Laboratory, Jinan, 250100, China. libaoying77@163.com.\"], 'abstract': 'Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic and potentially fatal lung disease and disorder.

The purpose of the study was to investigate the effect of biomimetic porous magnesium alloy scaffolds on repairing osteoporotic bone defects and possible mechanisms. The animal model of osteoporosis was established in female SD rats. Three months later, a bone defect of 3 mm in diameter and 3 mm in depth was created in the lateral condyle of the right femur. The rats were then randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. Four weeks after surgery, gross specimens were observed and micro-CT scans were performed. The repair of osteoporotic femoral defects in rats was studied histologically using HE staining, Masson staining, and Goldner staining. The expression of Wnt5a, β-catenin, and BMP-2 was measured between groups by immunohistochemical staining. The bone defect was repaired better after the application of biomimetic porous magnesium alloy scaffolds. Immunohistochemical results showed significantly higher expression of Wnt5a, β-catenin, and BMP-2.

AL is caused by the overproduction and aggregation of monoclonal immunoglobulin LCs produced by bone marrow plasma cells. Studies have shown that the initial response at a subcellular level to the toxicity of AL is lysosomal dysfunction with impaired autophagy, elevated reactive oxygen species, cellular dysfunction, and cellular death. Therefore, we speculate that the multiple myeloma complicated by cardiac amyloidosis is due to the deposition of λ LC fibrils in cardiomyocytes, leading to dysregulation of autophagy and cell death. We constructed BACN1 siRNA or FOXO3A siRNA and transfected them into H9c2 cells. We detected changes in oxidative stress- and autophagy-related markers. Our results show that monoclonal immunoglobulin λ LCs can form amyloid aggregates, which are cytotoxic to cardiomyocytes. λ LC fibrils deposit on the cell surface, causing oxidative stress and excessive autophagy by increasing Beclin-1 expression and the LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and decreasing p62 expression, ultimately inducing cell death. Beclin-1 knockdown reversed the increase in the LC3 II/LC3 I ratio and the decrease in p62 induced by LC fibrils, while suppressing overactivated autophagy and oxidative stress. Furthermore, LCs reduce the expression of p-Foxo3a (Ser253) (inactive) and promote Foxo3a translocation into the nucleus to perform transcriptional activity, which induces autophagy-related gene overexpression. Silencing Foxo3a can suppress excessive autophagy induced by LC fibrils and protect cells from death. In summary, the results showed that the cytotoxicity of amyloid fibrils formed by λ LCs on cardiomyocytes is triggered by excessive autophagy and is mediated through the Foxo3a/Beclin-1 pathway.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=37039144', 'pubdate': '2023-04-12', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'Humans'}, {'descriptor': 'Myocytes, Cardiac'}, {'descriptor': 'Beclin-1'}, {'descriptor': 'Amyloidosis'}, {'descriptor': 'Amyloid'}, {'descriptor': 'Autophagy'}, {'descriptor': 'Immunoglobulins'}]}, {'pmid': '36944281', 'title': 'Multitargeted drug design strategy for discovery of short-peptide-based HIV-1 entry inhibitors with high potency.', 'author': ['Chao Wang', 'Huan Wang', 'Xinling Wang', 'Lujia Sun', 'Qian Wang', 'Qing Li', 'Ruiying Liang', 'Dou Dou', 'Fei Yu', 'Lu Lu', 'Shibo Jiang'], 'affiliations': ['State Key Laboratory of Toxicology and Medical Countermeasures, Beijing Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, 27 Tai-Ping Road, Beijing, 100850, China.

Metastasis is the major cause of death in patients with SCLC but its mechanism remains poorly understood. An imbalance of hyaluronan catabolism in the extracellular matrix accelerates malignant progression in solid cancers due to the accumulation of low-molecular-weight HA. We previously found that CEMIP, a novel hyaluronidase, may act as a metastatic trigger in SCLC. In the present study, we found that both CEMIP and HA levels were higher in SCLC tissues than in paracancerous tissues from patient specimens and in vivo orthotopic models. Additionally, high expression of CEMIP was associated with lymphatic metastasis in patients with SCLC, and in vitro results showed that CEMIP expression was elevated in SCLC cells relative to human bronchial epithelial cells. Mechanistically, CEMIP facilitates the breakdown of HA and accumulation of LMW-HA. LMW-HA activates its receptor TLR2, and subsequently recruits c-Src to activate ERK1/2 signalling, thereby promoting F-actin rearrangement as well as migration and invasion of SCLC cells. In addition, the in vivo results verified that depletion of CEMIP attenuated HA levels and the expressions of TLR2, c-Src, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2, as well as liver and brain metastasis in SCLC xenografts. Furthermore, the application of the actin filament inhibitor latrunculin A significantly inhibited the liver and brain metastasis of SCLC in vivo. Collectively, our findings reveal the critical role of CEMIP-mediated HA degradation in SCLC metastasis and suggest its translational potential as an attractive target and a novel strategy for SCLC therapy.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36931608', 'pubdate': '2023-03-18', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'Humans'}, {'descriptor': 'Hyaluronic Acid'}, {'descriptor': 'Toll-Like Receptor 2'}, {'descriptor': 'MAP Kinase Signaling System'}, {'descriptor': 'Signal Transduction'}, {'descriptor': 'Brain Neoplasms'}]}, {'pmid': '36852460', 'title': 'LncRNA XLOC_015548 affects the proliferation and differentiation of myoblasts via the MAPK signaling pathway.', 'author': ['Yihao Wei', 'Tiantian Qi', 'Siyang Cao', 'Weifei Zhang', 'Fei Yu', 'Hui Zeng', 'Jian Weng'], 'affiliations': ['Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nShantou University Medical College, Shantou 515000, China.', 'Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.', 'Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.', 'Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.', 'Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.', 'Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.', 'Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen 518036, China.'], 'abstract': 'In recent years, an increasing number of studies have reported that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play essential regulatory roles in myogenic differentiation.

Lithium-containing scaffolds have been reported to effectively promote cartilage regeneration; however, whether lithium-containing biomaterial could facilitate cartilage regeneration through regulating BMSCs-derived exosomes has not been illustrated. In the study, the model lithium-substituted bioglass ceramic (Li-BGC) is selected and regulatory effects of BMSCs-derived exosomes after Li-BGC treatment (Li-BGC-Exo) are systemically evaluated. The data reveal that Li-BGC-Exo notably promotes chondrogenesis, which attributes to the upregulated exosomal miR-455-3p transfer, consequently leads to suppression of histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) and enhanced histone H3 acetylation in chondrocytes. Notably, BMSCs-derived exosomes after LiCl\\xa0treatment\\xa0(LiCl-Exo) exhibits the similar regulatory effect with Li-BGC-Exo, indicating that the pro-chondrogenesis capability of them is mainly owing to the lithium ions. Furthermore, the in vivo study proves that LiCl-Exo remarkably facilitates cartilage regeneration. The research may provide novel possibility for the intrinsic mechanism of chondrogenesis trigged by lithium-containing biomaterials, and suggests that application of lithium-containing scaffolds may be a promising strategy for cartilage regeneration.', 'html': 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=36623538', 'pubdate': '2023-01-10', 'pubYear': '2023', 'meshHeadings': [{'descriptor': 'MicroRNAs'}, {'descriptor': 'Biocompatible Materials'}, {'descriptor': 'Histones'}, {'descriptor': 'Lithium'}, {'descriptor': 'Acetylation'}, {'descriptor': 'Cartilage'}, {'descriptor': 'Chondrocytes'}, {'descriptor': 'Mesenchymal Stem Cells'}, {'descriptor': 'Exosomes'}]}, {'pmid': '36609338', 'title': 'Potential effects of teriparatide (PTH (1-34)) on osteoarthritis: a systematic review.', 'author': ['Guoqing Li', 'Su Liu', 'Huihui Xu', 'Yixiao Chen', 'Jiapeng Deng', 'Ao Xiong', 'Deli Wang', 'Jian Weng', 'Fei Yu', 'Liang Gao', 'Changhai Ding', 'Hui Zeng'], 'affiliations': [\"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China.\", 'Center for Clinical Medicine, Huatuo Institute of Medical Innovation (HTIMI), Berlin, Germany. lianggao@web.de.\\nSino Euro Orthopaedics Network (SEON), Berlin, Germany. lianggao@web.de.', \"Clinical Research Centre, Zhujiang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, People's Republic of China. changhai.ding@utas.edu.au.\", \"Department of Bone & Joint Surgery, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China. zenghui_36@163.com.\\nNational & Local Joint Engineering Research Center of Orthopaedic Biomaterials, Peking University Shenzhen Hospital, Shenzhen, 518036, People's Republic of China. zenghui_36@163.com.\"], 'abstract': 'Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common and prevalent degenerative joint disease characterized by degradation of the articular cartilage.

ARGs are participatory experiences, because players have a central role in reconstructing the storyline. Furthermore, players interact with the game as themselves, not via avatars. Although transmedia formats like ARGs have garnered increasing attention in entertainment and education, most have been targeted for adults 18 and older. Few studies have explored the design process of education-based ARGs for children. In this paper, we detail the design and implementation of an ARG for middle school students (13--15 years old). We describe the strategies we used to distribute story elements across various media and to encourage players to participate in an authentic inquiry process. We found that a 'protagonist by proxy', or in-game character with whom players related closely, served as a strong motivator and a model for positive participation.

This panel brings together three librarians from different institutional contexts to interrogate DH infrastructure as a primarily social -and irrational -formation. If DH infrastructure is 'only' what we make of it, how do we consciously, actively shape DH infrastructure to support what DH could be? How do the social formations of DH infrastructure activate -but also potentially inhibit -access by scholars, students, and publics? How do certain social formations of institutional DH mask the emotional labor of DH professionals supporting the work of other researchers? And finally, what is the relationship between infrastructure and underlying institutional culture? Can a critically engaged infrastructure overcome or repair a culture that may undermine the values that we want to instill? Laura Braunstein will explore the challenges of sustaining DH infrastructure without a DH center. Project management, collaboration, outreach, and digital pedagogy take an ad-hoc and at times, rogue presence, connected only by virtual infrastructure. A DH community of practice that exists primarily as a social network can enable serendipitous connections, but it is not sustainable, for scholars, teams, or projects. How can we institutionalize a virtual DH noncenter in order to support activities and projects without inhibiting its energy and possibility? Thomas Padilla will explore assumptions latent in prevailing notions of scalability in the Digital Humanities. The need to qualify DH infrastructure development, web-based projects, and data sources by the extent to which they are scalable or not tends have the effect of either totally disincentivizing participation by cultural heritage organizations or incentivizing in a manner that tends to occlude acts of individual agency and creation. How can we work to develop practices and methods for exposing and according value to a wide range of cultural heritage work? In what ways does exposing agency and according value to intellectual and physical labor a necessary predicate of research integrity in DH? Amanda Visconti will explore how we might align DH resource investment with explicit personal and intellectual values such as inclusion and open access. Multiple DH centers already define the scope of the DH they support not through some over-generalization (e.g. u201cwe support innovation in humanities via digital scholarshipu201d), but instead through charters envisioning and encouraging a DH that performs what we care about. How do we use the wiggle room at our disposal, small or large, to push our institutions toward supporting a better DH? How can we act on our values through policies that center resources on work strengthening these values?\", ['L.

ARGs require significant resources not only in terms of initial design, but also in implementation, since live, dynamic interplay between players and designers is an inherent aspect of their interactive storylines. This paper outlines a novel design framework for creating reusable ARGs that will help extend the lifespan of ARGs and allow them to permeate new domains such as education. The framework includes three key reusable design objectives (replayability, adaptability, extensibility), each of which can be enacted at different levels of depth.

In particular, we found that the approach that designers take to incorporate in-game protagonists ('protagonist-by-proxies' and 'protagonist-mentors') can influence the ways in which 1) players gain access to the disparate narrative and ludic elements within an ARG and 2) designers can integrate collaborative learning opportunities authentically into the narrative and gameplay.\", ['Elizabeth M.

ARGs are participatory experiences, because players have a central role in reconstructing the storyline. Furthermore, players interact with the game as themselves, not via avatars. Although transmedia formats like ARGs have garnered increasing attention in entertainment and education, most have been targeted for adults 18 and older. Few studies have explored the design process of education-based ARGs for children. In this paper, we detail the design and implementation of an ARG for middle school students (13--15 years old). We describe the strategies we used to distribute story elements across various media and to encourage players to participate in an authentic inquiry process. We found that a 'protagonist by proxy', or in-game character with whom players related closely, served as a strong motivator and a model for positive participation. We highlight student interactions and offer insights for designers who implement ARGs and similar immersive learning experiences.\", ['Elizabeth M. Bonsignore', 'Derek L.

This panel brings together three librarians from different institutional contexts to interrogate DH infrastructure as a primarily social -and irrational -formation. If DH infrastructure is 'only' what we make of it, how do we consciously, actively shape DH infrastructure to support what DH could be? How do the social formations of DH infrastructure activate -but also potentially inhibit -access by scholars, students, and publics? How do certain social formations of institutional DH mask the emotional labor of DH professionals supporting the work of other researchers? And finally, what is the relationship between infrastructure and underlying institutional culture? Can a critically engaged infrastructure overcome or repair a culture that may undermine the values that we want to instill? Laura Braunstein will explore the challenges of sustaining DH infrastructure without a DH center. Project management, collaboration, outreach, and digital pedagogy take an ad-hoc and at times, rogue presence, connected only by virtual infrastructure. A DH community of practice that exists primarily as a social network can enable serendipitous connections, but it is not sustainable, for scholars, teams, or projects. How can we institutionalize a virtual DH noncenter in order to support activities and projects without inhibiting its energy and possibility? Thomas Padilla will explore assumptions latent in prevailing notions of scalability in the Digital Humanities. The need to qualify DH infrastructure development, web-based projects, and data sources by the extent to which they are scalable or not tends have the effect of either totally disincentivizing participation by cultural heritage organizations or incentivizing in a manner that tends to occlude acts of individual agency and creation. How can we work to develop practices and methods for exposing and according value to a wide range of cultural heritage work? In what ways does exposing agency and according value to intellectual and physical labor a necessary predicate of research integrity in DH? Amanda Visconti will explore how we might align DH resource investment with explicit personal and intellectual values such as inclusion and open access. Multiple DH centers already define the scope of the DH they support not through some over-generalization (e.g. u201cwe support innovation in humanities via digital scholarshipu201d), but instead through charters envisioning and encouraging a DH that performs what we care about. How do we use the wiggle room at our disposal, small or large, to push our institutions toward supporting a better DH? How can we act on our values through policies that center resources on work strengthening these values?\", ['L.

ARGs require significant resources not only in terms of initial design, but also in implementation, since live, dynamic interplay between players and designers is an inherent aspect of their interactive storylines. This paper outlines a novel design framework for creating reusable ARGs that will help extend the lifespan of ARGs and allow them to permeate new domains such as education. The framework includes three key reusable design objectives (replayability, adaptability, extensibility), each of which can be enacted at different levels of depth.

      "[('Tools for Data-Driven Scholarship: Past, Present, Future', 'On October 22-24, 2008, nearly fifty scholars, librarians, museum professionals, computer scientists, software developers, and funders attended a workshop at Turf Valley Resort in Ellicott City, Maryland, to discuss the past, present, and future of tools that can assist scholarship in an age of massive digital resources. The workshop, co-funded by the National Science Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services, brought these people together because of their active engagement with the production and use of these digital tools and their deep knowledge of associated issues such as scholarly communication and sustainability. (Please see Appendix A for a list of attendees.)    The discussion was pragmatic rather than ideological; the goal was to understand from experience and example how such tools could be created, disseminated, and built upon in a more effective way than has been the norm. In 2005, the NSF sponsored a Summit on Digital Tools for the Humanities in conjunction with the University of Virginiau2019s Institute for Advanced Technology in the Humanities.

We are concerned with contemporary writers of belles-lettres (fiction, poetry, and drama), and the implications of the shift toward word processing and other forms of electronic text production for the future of the cultural record, in particular literary scholarship. The urgency of this topic is evidenced by the recent deaths of several high-profile authors, including David Foster Wallace and John Updike, both of whom are known to have left behind electronic records containing unpublished and incomplete work alongside of their more traditional manuscript materials. We argue that literary and other creatively-oriented originators offer unique challenges for the preservation enterprise, since the complete digital context for individual records is often of paramount importanceu2014what Richard Ovenden, in a helpful phrase (in conversation) has termed u201cthe digital materiality of digital culture.u201d We will therefore discuss preservation and access scenarios that account for the computer as a complete artifact and digital environment, drawing on examples from the born-digital materials in literary collections at Emory University, the Harry Ransom Center at The University of Texas at Austin, and the University of Maryland.', ['M.

'It was nine-seventeen in the morning, and the house was heavy,' it begins. Later, it produces this utterance: 'It was a strange thing.' This strange thing, which is to say this strange text, is, I argue, a boutique literary exemplar of the most widely read (and written) category of texts in the world today, as algorithms perform not speech acts but speculative or 'spec' acts--what Felix Guattari forecast three decades ago as 'machines speaking to machines.'

This essay reads 1 the Road, a 20,000-word token of narrative fiction produced by digital sensors affixed to an automobile driven from New York to New Orleans (the route taken by Jack Kerouac), whose outputs are filtered through an artificial intelligence technology called a neural net to produce the text. 'It was nine-seventeen in the morning, and the house was heavy,' it begins. Later, it produces this utterance: 'It was a strange thing.' This strange thing, which is to say this strange text, is, I argue, a boutique literary exemplar of the most widely read (and written) category of texts in the world today, as algorithms perform not speech acts but speculative or 'spec' acts--what Felix Guattari forecast three decades ago as 'machines speaking to machines.'
