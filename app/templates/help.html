        retrieve relevant news articles based on your keywords and display them in an organized manner. You can explore
        the news clusters by clicking on the nodes in the visualization, which represent different topics or themes. By
        interacting with the visualization, you can navigate through the news clusters, view related articles, and gain
        insights into the news content. You can zoom in or zoom out of the visualization to explore the news clusters in
        more detail.
    </p>
    <p>
        ShowMe.news provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to explore news articles in a
        dynamic and interactive way, making it easy to discover and engage with relevant information.
    </p>

    <h1>Eye-Tracking and Cluster Interaction</h1>
    <p>
        ShowMe.news incorporates an innovative <strong>eye-tracking feature</strong> that enhances the user interaction experience.
        By leveraging eye-tracking technology, users can hover over a cluster in the visualization, and the system
        automatically selects the cluster and displays relevant documents associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you hover your mouse (or gaze, in the case of eye-tracking systems) over a cluster node, a context menu or 
        relevant options such as "Show Documents" will appear. You can use these options to explore the articles related 
        to that cluster without needing to click, allowing for seamless navigation and exploration.
    </p>
    <p>
        This feature is particularly useful for users who want to quickly browse through topics and identify key clusters
        of interest without any additional clicks, making the interface even more intuitive and responsive.
    </p>

    <h1>Calibration Step: Setting Up Eye-Tracking</h1>
    <p>
        To make the most of the eye-tracking feature, it's essential to calibrate the system before use. The calibration
        process ensures accuracy in detecting your gaze and associating it with clusters in the visualization. Follow
        these steps to calibrate:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>When you first access the system, a calibration popup will appear. Click "Start" to begin.</li>
        <li>Interact with the nine calibration points displayed on the screen. Click on each point <strong>five times</strong>
            until it turns yellow.</li>
        <li>Once all points are calibrated, stare at the center of the screen for five seconds to calculate accuracy.</li>
        <li>You can recalibrate at any time by selecting the "Recalibrate" option in the navigation menu.</li>
    </ul>
