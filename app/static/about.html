    <!-- Add a paragraph how dynamic news clustering based on user entered keyboard is useful -->
    <!-- Dynamic news clustering based on user-entered keywords provides a powerful tool for organizing and analyzing large amounts of news data in real time. By allowing users to input specific keywords, the system can quickly retrieve relevant news articles, group them into meaningful clusters, and present them in an organized manner. This approach is particularly useful because it enables users to efficiently sift through vast amounts of news content, identify trends, and explore topics of interest without manually sorting through individual articles. It also enhances the user experience by providing a visual and interactive way to explore related content, facilitating better understanding of complex news stories and their relationships. This dynamic clustering system can be used in various applications, from media monitoring and sentiment analysis to research and personalized news recommendations, making it a valuable tool for both individuals and businesses. -->
