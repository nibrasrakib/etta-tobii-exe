The following are the settings for Javascript code format.

I used an extension called Prettier in VS code. https://prettier.io/docs/en/install.html
The tab is a 4 space tab
newline brackets instead of trailing brackets.

Note: All of the {{}} (Jinja templating) is based on Python, so it won't work if put into a .js file. Therefore, all of the variable declaration using {{}} need to remain in HTML under a script tag.
