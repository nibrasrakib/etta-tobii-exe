1. Download gene data from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, which should be a text file
2. The info of one gene would be on a single line and we could take advantage of that and use vim to clean up some data we don't need
3. To get rid of genes with "hypothetical protein" in their descriptions, we'll use vim to delete lines containing such keyword;
	to do that, we open up the gene data text file with vim and run the following command: :g/hypothetical protein/d
	to save and quit vim, run :wq
4. Now we have a cleaned up text file. To use it in our actual program, we'll need to convert it to a csv file:
	open up excel and import the text file; only import the column "Symbol(Gene name)," "descriptions," and "Aliases/Synonyms"; 
	Use excel's built in function to convert it to a csv file
5. In python program, use pandas to load the csv file as dataframes and convert the dataframes into a python set, which is essentially a hash map.
	The code that does this is currently in the function load_gene_data() in visual_library_plos.py
